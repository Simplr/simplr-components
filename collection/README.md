# Simplr Component collection

Simple Component Collection is a collection of all Simplr Components into one npm install.

Normally we would recommend users to install only the components they
need, but for example in fast prototyping situations it might be easier
to just get started with coding, and for those situations Simplr Collection is your best bet
